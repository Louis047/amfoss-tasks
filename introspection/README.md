### _Why must we choose you?_
   First things first , i gotta say that am from a maths bio background and have learnt java during 10th which i've totally forgotten the concepts by now üòÇ. I'm a PC building enthusiast ,love learning about different types of operating system and testing them. I wanted to do coding because i just love typing lmao and also , its fun to do since we got many,many solutions for just one problem with different logic. I love to experience new things in technological environment and that's why i chose this üòâ.

### _What is your plan for the next 6 months?_
   Actually , not much plans right now but yeah , try to imrpove in coding and interacting with PC builders to get more and more infos.Most importantly, have to maintain my academic progress which is a hell lot of workload for me cuz it's hard for me to manage time ( trying to do it since i shifted to hostel here ). Finally , try to join a club which i am familiar with :)
   
### _How would you contribute back to the club?_
   I would like to work as a tech support for amFOSS and learn coding during the free hours, and being supportive to fellow memebers üëç. I really hope you guys bring a PC Building section in your club which will be helpful for PC enthusiasts.

### _Do you have any feedback on the selection process?_
   Nothing to imrprove for now since you guys rocked it fr üî•I love you guys for supporting me throughtout the amFOSS progress. Special thanks to Rajagopalan, Aman and Gauthan Krishnan bros who helped me a lot üòÑ.
