__My Journey on doing the Tasks so far ....__
--
At first, these things felt very new to me since i was new to linux and everything given in the tasks and especially github ( although have used it before for other purpose ) which made me lose motivation at first but didnt give up and started loving to do it as it was pretty much challenging for me since the starting from Installing Ubuntu ( I love installing Operating Systems :smile: ) till Bandit Task , left some of them in the middle as i have no idea about it. The hardest task i've ever did is `Cinebot` and i couldnt complete it sadly as it was complicated for me. The easiest one is `Terminal Hunt` I gave my best to do the tasks as far as i can, learnt a lot of stuffs during my journey and my coding skills kind-of improved than before.To make it short, Had a good time doing the tasks :thumbsup:.Arigato to whoever reads this!
