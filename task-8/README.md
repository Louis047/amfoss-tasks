Done this task finally at the last moment, didnt know that it will be easy  `[was scared before cuz of javascript ðŸ˜…]`
I was able to prcoeed this cuz had some experience with css before , edited for an online game called [Krunker.io](https://krunker.io/)

### Steps that I've Done:
   1.Importing the JS and CSS script to `index.html` with <link> and <script> tags

   2.Coded in `index.js` to call the play function for importing the sound files into each keys displayed in the drum kit and linked them with onclick event
.
  
   3.Replaced the background with an image and altered the colours of the elements with gradient blue
 
   4.Changed the Header Font to [Anton](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Anton) and element fonts to [Lobster](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster)

### Final Result
